### What is AI?
AI stands for artificial intelligence, which is the ability of a computer system or a robot to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems. 
AI is a broad term that covers many different technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and more

### What is Machine Leaning(ML)?
Machine learning is turning things(data) to numbers and finding pattern from those numbers.
ML algorithms can be divided into three main types: 
1. supervised learning
2. unsupervised learning
3. reinforcement learning

***Supervised learning*** is when the algorithm learns from labeled data, such as images with captions or emails with spam or not spam labels. 

***Unsupervised learning*** is when the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, such as customer transactions or social media posts. 

***Reinforcement learning*** is when the algorithm learns from its own actions and rewards, such as a self-driving car or a video game agent,etc.,

### What is Deep Learning(DL)?
Deep learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to learn from large amounts of data and perform complex tasks. Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that mimic the structure and function of the human brain. DL can be used for various applications, such as image recognition, natural language generation, speech synthesis, and more...
